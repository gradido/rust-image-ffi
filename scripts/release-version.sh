#   scripts/release-version.sh version                 the version in Cargo.toml
#   scripts/release-version.sh released                the highest version already tagged
#   scripts/release-version.sh check <title> <base>    exits 0 when the pull request is
#                                                      consistent, non-zero with a reason when not
#
# `check` writes exactly one line to stdout -- "release: v<version>" or "not a release: <title>" --
# and everything a human needs to read to stderr. A workflow decides on that one line, so a note
# added here never changes what it decides.
#
# A release is a pull request whose title says "release" and whose Cargo.toml version has not been
# released before. What is hard and what is a note:
#
#   hard   the title says release, so nothing publishes by accident -- a version bump that only
#          prepares the next round stays unpublished
#   hard   v<version> is not tagged yet, and comes after every tag: a released version is never
#          rebuilt and the line never goes backwards
#   hard   a version named in the title is the version in Cargo.toml -- "release v0.0.1" with
#          0.1.0 in the file is a mistake, and it is the one that is easiest to make
#   note   the version is the same as on the base branch. Allowed: the first release of a version
#          that was written down long before it went out, and bumping in one pull request and
#          releasing in another, are both ordinary. The tag rules above are what keep it honest.
