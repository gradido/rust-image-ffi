# Builds the release staticlib and turns it into what this module ships, per object format:
#
#   ELF, Mach-O   one relocatable object in which only the rimg_ functions are global
#   COFF          the staticlib itself; see *Windows* below
#
# ELF covers glibc and musl. A musl build is for a caller that links musl dynamically -- a Node
# addon on Alpine is a shared object --, so it is built without crt-static and asks for libgcc_s,
# which every Alpine with a C++ runtime has, instead of a static libunwind, which none has by
# default. The archive carries no libc of its own either way.
#
# Why localize: two Rust staticlibs built with different rustc versions collide on
# rust_eh_personality when linked into one binary, and a #[global_allocator] in one of them fails
# the link or silently takes over the other's allocations. A localized object has neither problem.
#
#   scripts/localize.sh [target-triple]
#       -> dist/<triple or host>/{rust_image_ffi.o | rust_image_ffi.lib | librust_image_ffi.a},
#          rust_image_ffi.h, NATIVE_LIBS.txt, SHA256SUMS
#
# Windows: MSVC's toolchain has no partial link -- neither link.exe nor lld-link takes -r -- so
# there is nothing to localize into. The .lib ships as it is. The clash localization avoids is
# ELF's: a COMDAT group named DW.ref.rust_eh_personality. COFF has no counterpart of it, and two
# staticlibs that carry std twice are folded by COMDAT selection. Untested with a second Rust
# staticlib in one binary, and recorded as such in README.md.
#
# MinGW (*-windows-gnu for mingw-w64's gcc, *-windows-gnullvm for zig and llvm-mingw) ships the
# staticlib as well, as librust_image_ffi.a, for the same reason and with the same caveat. GNU ld
# could link a PE object partially; nobody has tried what the result does to Rust's unwind tables.
# These targets are built from any host -- a staticlib needs no linker -- which is why the format
# below follows the target and not the machine.
